## Features

1. On medium to large devices sidebar with icons will be visible. Once clicked on any icon the respective navigation menus will open. As of now Menus will be visible for home page only as others are not developed.

2. To close the navigation menus click on the same sidebar icon again for which menu is open.

2. Initially application will open in default theme. User can change the theme by clicking on theme icon at the top of sidebar menu.

## Responsiveness

```bash
Note: Since figma was not given, I have developed the mobile view with my perspective.
```

1. In small devices, by default no sidebar will appear. Only a breadcrumb icon would be visible to user. Once the user clicks on breadcrumb icon sidebar will open. 

2. Now user can click on any icon in sidebar to view related navigation menus. 

3. Once navigation menu is open, there would be cross icon at the top right corner which user can use to close the sidebar menu.

Note: There could have been more feature like collapsible navigation menu but sidebar remain open and then closing the sidebar if required. Since the requirement was just simply create the sidebar, hence have done with minimal features.
